# CryptoClustering

This challenge uses KMeans and PCA to look at stock data.  The first is original stock data that hasn't been transformed yet with PCA and looks at the clustering plot.  The second is transformed PCA data with a clustering plot.  The data has been standard scaled for all data points.  The two graphs are compared to see which is a better indicator of trends.  The PCA transformed data provides better clustering than the original stock data.
